ðŸ§­ A completely free PHP tool for visually creating MySQL pivot tables without writing any code. All you need to do is visually connect to your database and define the data sources for the different sections of your pivot table. ðŸ§©

---

## Overview

- The project is a PHP-based solution that helps you build pivot tables against MySQL without touching SQL. It focuses on a visual builder that maps database tables or views to pivot table parts like rows, columns, and values.
- It targets developers, data analysts, and teams who want fast, repeatable reporting without the complexity of SQL scripting.
- The tool embraces the core ideas of cross-tab reports, adâ€‘hoc analysis, and data storytelling through pivot insights.

This repository is a practical tool for teams that need repeatable pivot reports in a PHP-friendly environment. It works with MySQL as the data source and exports results in common formats. It also provides a straightforward way to store and reuse pivot definitions.

---

## Features

- Visual pivot builder: connect to a MySQL database, pick tables and views, and map fields to pivot axes.
- No-code data shaping: define rows, columns, and metrics with drag-and-drop interactions.
- Flexible data sources: combine multiple tables or views, with simple join rules created through the UI.
- Aggregations: sum, count, average, min, max, distinct count, and custom expressions.
- Filtering and slicing: add row/column filters, apply date and numeric ranges, and create dynamic slices.
- Sorting: order by any field, by aggregation, or by calculated expressions.
- Grouping and hierarchies: create multi-level row and column groupings for drill-down analysis.
- Calculated fields: derive metrics using simple expressions without editing SQL.
- Export options: export results as CSV, Excel (XLSX), or PDF-ready tables.
- Reusable pivot definitions: save and reuse pivot templates across projects.
- Lightweight and fast: designed for quick startup on common PHP stacks and MySQL databases.
- Local storage of pivots: keep pivots in a local repository or database for team sharing.
- Basic role-based access: simple permission model to protect pivot definitions.
- Themed UI: clean, accessible interface with keyboard navigation.

---

## What this project is not

- It is not a full BI suite. It focuses on pivot-style analysis and export workflows.
- It is not a heavy server-side analytics engine. It offers a practical, easy-to-use pivot builder on top of MySQL.
- It is not vendor-locked. It aims to stay PHP-friendly and MySQL-native.

---

## Why use a visual pivot builder

- Speed: you can spin up pivot reports in minutes instead of writing SQL.
- Clarity: pivot tables reveal patterns and outliers in a compact form.
- Reproducibility: save pivot definitions and apply them to new datasets without rework.
- Accessibility: team members with basic SQL knowledge can still build powerful reports.

The tool emphasizes calm confidence in its design. It pairs straightforward UI choices with robust data handling to minimize friction for everyday analysis tasks.

## How the tool works

- Visual data mapping: The UI provides an intuitive workspace where you connect to data sources, map fields to the pivot axes, and set up aggregations.
- Query generation: The builder translates your visual configuration into efficient SQL queries that MySQL can execute.
- Result rendering: Pivot results render in a clean table with options to switch between compact and detailed views.
- Export pipeline: Built results can be exported to CSV, XLSX, or PDF (for reporting purposes) with minimal formatting loss.
- State management: Pivot definitions are stored so you can reload and reuse them across sessions and projects.

This flow keeps you in control while reducing the complexity often associated with pivot-style reporting in SQL.

---

## Architecture and design

- MVC-inspired structure: A lightweight separation between data access, business logic, and the user interface keeps the system maintainable.
- Data access layer: A small, safe abstraction around MySQL queries reduces risk and makes it easier to implement future adapters.
- Pivot engine: A compact engine handles row/column definitions, aggregations, and user-specified filters in memory before submitting queries to MySQL.
- UI layer: A responsive interface supports drag-and-drop, keyboard navigation, and accessible controls.
- Extensibility: The codebase is designed to accept plug-ins for themes, additional data sources, and export options.

This architecture supports a clean development flow and makes it feasible to extend the tool with new features without rewriting core parts.

## Connecting to MySQL: step-by-step

- Create a connection
  - Host: the address of your MySQL server.
  - Port: the port MySQL listens on (default is 3306).
  - User: an account with access to the necessary databases.
  - Password: the password for the user.
- Test the connection
  - Click Test to confirm the credentials and network reachability.
  - If the test fails, verify firewall settings, user permissions, and the host address.
- Choose data sources
  - Pick one or more tables or views to include in your pivot.
  - If needed, define virtual joins by linking fields across sources using UI rules (not SQL code).
- Define pivot axes
  - Rows: select fields for the row axis.
  - Columns: select fields for the column axis.
  - Values: choose one or more metrics and specify aggregations.
- Add filters
  - Apply date ranges, status filters, or numeric ranges to narrow data.
  - Create hierarchical filters that shrink the dataset layer by layer.
- Preview and adjust
  - Preview the first few rows of the pivot to verify the mapping.
  - Adjust data types, formats, and aggregations as needed.

This sequence helps you get a pivot up and running quickly while preserving control over the data sources.

## Data sources and data modeling

- Data sources
  - Tables and views from a MySQL database serve as data sources.
  - You can combine multiple sources in a single pivot to cross-analyze data.
- Joins and relationships
  - Relationships are defined through the UI, avoiding raw SQL joins in most cases.
  - The tool supports common join types like INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT, with clear explanations of how they affect results.
- Data shaping
  - You can choose fields to include in the row and column axes.
  - You can create calculated fields that depend on existing fields, enabling custom metrics.
- Data quality
  - The UI provides validation to catch missing fields or mismatched types.
  - It highlights potential data quality issues that could impact pivot results.
- Data governance
  - Access to data sources is controlled by the connection settings and user permissions in the UI.
  - Pivot sharing can be restricted to certain teams or roles.

This design keeps data modeling centered on the user experience while remaining grounded in reliable database practices.

## Pivot building: best practices

- Start with key metrics
  - Begin with a few essential metrics to understand the data distribution.
  - Add more metrics once you have a stable view of the data.
- Use meaningful hierarchies
  - Create logical row and column hierarchies, such as Year > Quarter > Month or Region > Country > City.
  - Hierarchies help reveal patterns at different levels of detail.
- Apply sensible filters
  - Use date ranges to limit data to relevant periods.
  - Filter out anomalous or irrelevant records to improve clarity.
- Keep it simple
  - Avoid too many axes in a single pivot; focus on a few core insights at a time.
  - Consolidate similar categories to reduce noise.
- Validate results
  - Compare pivot results with raw SQL queries for a small sample to build confidence.
  - Use export formats to share a reproducible view with stakeholders.

These practices help you extract meaningful insights without getting lost in complexity.

## Export and reporting

- Export formats
  - CSV: ideal for data exchange and quick import into other tools.
  - XLSX: preserves formatting and supports further editing in spreadsheet apps.
  - PDF: suitable for fixed-layout reports suitable for distribution.
- PDF considerations
  - Include a title, a table of contents (optional), and a few summary metrics.
  - Use clear fonts and legible sizes to ensure readability.
- Embedding pivot views
  - Exported reports can include multiple pivots on a single page.
  - You can define page structure to place pivots in a composed report layout.
- Scheduling exports
  - Basic scheduling can be set up to generate exports at defined intervals.
  - Consider pairing with a cron job or a task scheduler on your server.

Exporting pivots helps you deliver consistent reports to your team without manual rework.
